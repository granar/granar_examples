	<!-- Hormone convection-diffusion-degradation (activated by setting the value of Sym_contagion and/or Apo_contagion to 2 in *_General.xml)
	     Hormone movement is calculated at steady-state within the symplast or apoplast.
		 Degradation
		 Units: mol degraded / mol-day
		 The diffusivity & degradation constant allows avoiding the infinite accumulation of solutes in locations that do not export the hormone.
		 24: average lifetime of an hour (Normanly 1997, Auxin metabolism)
		 Diffusion
		 Units: cm^2 / day
		 0.035: value for mannitol in cell walls (Knipfer et al., 2007)
		 1.2: value for K (Foster & Miklavcic, 2017)
		 2.0: Value for D2O in water (Spyrou et al., 2016)
		 The source cells are defined in *_Geometry*.xml, and the concentration in source cells is set to the constant 1 (relative concentration) -->

	<!-- Hormone active transport (activated by setting the value of Sym_contagion and Apo_contagion to 2 in *_General.xml)
	     Active transport is calculated assuming that hormone concentration is low enough to be proportional to concentration (linear part of the Michaelis-Menten curve)
		 Efflux carriers send the hormone from the symplast to the apoplast, while influx cariiers do the opposite
		 Active transport constants (=Vmax/KM)
		 Units: liter / day-micron²
		 3.9E-16: ABA efflux carrier ABCG25 (Kuromori et al. 2010), assuming 55 kDa carrier, and 100 carriers per micron²
		 5.8E-14: ABA influx carrier NFP4, previously AIT1 (Kanno et al., 2012), assuming same carrier density as in transformed yeast, and yeast spherical cell diameter of 6 microns
		 Direction: +1 is influx, -1 is efflux

				 3 		= endodermis
