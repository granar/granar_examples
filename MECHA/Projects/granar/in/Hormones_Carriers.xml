	<!-- Symplastic contagion inputs
		If flow_BC is set to 0: cc_dist is the prescribed static relative concentration in the cell (cc_prox is not used). Units: relative concentration
		If flow_BC is set to 1: The concentration will be multiplied by the incoming water flow rate in order to get the concentration flux arriving into the cell. Units: relative concentration to be multiplied by the associated convective flux in cm³/d
		In case of solute flow BC, concentrations in the distal and proximal ends can be prescribed, though only the concentration upstream of water flow will be considered
		In case of transient simulation, steady-state BC generate initial conditions from the steady-state solution (except if cc prescribed in input file). Transient BC define the new boundary condition at time 0.
		The current code does not allow to have both pressure- and flux-type boundary conditions at the same node
		Set Transient_sim to "nan" in Time_information in order not to have a transient simulation
