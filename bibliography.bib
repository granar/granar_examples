               Javaux, Mathieu and Chaumont, Fran{\c c}ois and Draye, Xavier",
  abstract  = "As water often limits crop production, a more complete
               understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary.
               Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the
               flow of water across the root at the scale of walls, membranes,
               and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test
               hypotheses related to root water transport in maize (Zea mays).
               The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a
               minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the
               conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata,
               which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of
               water pathways and root radial hydraulic conductivity (kr).
               MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic theories derived
               independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible
               only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are
               uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of
               apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between
               estimated kr in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while
               the contribution of water-filled intercellular spaces was
               limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the
               relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of
               plasma membranes on root kr and suggested that only the latter
               contributed substantially to kr due to the composite nature of
               water flow across roots. The explicit root hydraulic anatomy
               framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of
               experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to
               efficiently address questions pertaining to root water
               relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale
               communication in the world of root hydraulics.",

  abstract = "It is increasingly important in life sciences that many
              cell-scale and tissue-scale measurements are quantified from
              confocal microscope images. However, extracting and analyzing
              large-scale confocal image data sets represents a major
              bottleneck for researchers. To aid this process, CellSeT software
              has been developed, which utilizes tissue-scale structure to help
              segment individual cells. We provide examples of how the CellSeT
              software can be used to quantify fluorescence of
              hormone-responsive nuclear reporters, determine membrane protein
              polarity, extract cell and tissue geometry for use in later
              modeling, and take many additional biologically relevant measures
              using an extensible plug-in toolset. Application of CellSeT
              promises to remove subjectivity from the resulting data sets and
              facilitate higher-throughput, quantitative approaches to plant
              cell research.",
